This directory contains 'cubes' with
* extent defined by
    + first directory
    + polygon layers available in R:/projects/landscapes/data/vector
    + e.g. bounding box around the intersection of SA with IBRA Subregions is sa_ibrasub_xn
    + boundary is also defined by aoi.parquet (a simple feature ('sf') spatial object 'parquet' file)
* grain defined by
    + second directory
    + using ISO 8601 time periods and resolution in metres 
    + e.g. P1M__90 is a grain of 1 month * 90 m * 90 m
* source and collection defined by
    + third directory
    + e.g. DEA is Digital Earth Australia and ga_ls7e_ard_3--ga_ls5t_ard_3 includes both of DEAs Landsat 5 and 7 analysis ready data collections
    + see https://explorer.dea.ga.gov.au/products for details on DEA collections
* bands
    + as file names
    + e.g. band_name__start_date.tif
    + where start_date is the starting date for the grain period
    + values contain (usually) median of any cells in the original stack, as defined by the grain, but excluding 
      + images with < 10% cloud
      + pixels identified as cloud or cloud mask
* crs
    + epsg 8059

Indices, always generated as (first_band - second_band) / (first_band + second_band), are:
* ndwi = c("green", "nir")
    + normalized difference water index
    + for Landsat 8-9, NDWI = (Band 3 – Band 5) / (Band 3 + Band 5)
* ndvi = c("nir", "red")
    + normalized difference vegetation index
    + for Landsat 8-9, NDVI = (Band 5 – Band 4) / (Band 5 + Band 4)
* nbr = c("nir", "swir_2") 
    + normalized burn ratio
    + for Landsat 8-9, NBR = (Band 5 – Band 7) / (Band 5 + Band 7)
* nbr2 = c("swir_1", "swir_2")
    + normalized burned ratio index 2
    + for Landsat 8-9, NBR2 = (Band 6 – Band 7) / (Band 6 + Band 7)
* ndmi = c("nir", "swir_1")
    + normalized difference moisture index
    + for Landsat 8-9, NDMI = (Band 5 – Band 6) / (Band 5 + Band 6)
